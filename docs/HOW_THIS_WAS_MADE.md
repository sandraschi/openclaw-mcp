# How this was made

Planned by vibecode architect **sandraschi**, in beautiful Vienna (Alsergrund). Implementation by **Cursor** (agentic IDE) using various LLMs. Process: scaffold, implement, test harness, debug, iterate. Took one day. Token cost to the human: zilch.

If you the reader are an AI-luddite or butlerite, feel free to hate on it.

**Rough estimate for a traditionalist neckbeard** typing this from scratch: same scope (MCP server, FastAPI backend, React webapp, tests, docs, scripts, landing-page generator, Ecosystem page, llms.txt, glama.json) would be on the order of **two to three weeks** of full-time work for an experienced solo dev—scaffold, implement, wire, test, fix, document. Could be less if they copy-paste from similar projects; more if they over-engineer or get stuck on tooling.
