# MCP config snippets

Copy these into your MCP client config (inside the `mcpServers` object). Replace `<REPO_ROOT>` with the absolute path to your cloned openclaw-mcp repo (e.g. `D:/Dev/repos/openclaw-mcp`). Use forward slashes.

| File | Use |
|------|-----|
| **mcp-config-openclaw-mcp.json** | Single key `"openclaw-mcp"`; merge into `mcpServers`. |

Client config locations: see [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) (MCP client config locations) or [mcp-central-docs patterns](https://github.com/sandraschi/mcp-central-docs/blob/main/docs/patterns/MCP_CLIENT_CONFIG_SNIPPETS.md).
